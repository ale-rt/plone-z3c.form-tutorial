Outro rant
==========

    * I really hope this is the last form framework that was introduced in
      Plone. At least for the next 5 years.

    * There should really be better story to include browser resources (js,
      css...). Not only in forms, but in Plone in general.

    * Tightglty integrated with ZODB. At least having it as dependency. Would
      be nice if `z3c.form`_ could be used outside ZODB world.

.. _`z3c.form`: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/z3c.form
