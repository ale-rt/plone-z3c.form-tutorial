What's new
==========

A lot have changed, or better to say, a lot was improved since last year. Most
improvements were introduced because of work on `Dexterity`_. Tools we are
going to look into are:

    * `plone.z3cform`_: Provides integration with `Zope2`_, introduces 
      ``Fieldsets``, ``Form extenders`` and ``CRUD forms``.

    * `plone.app.z3cform`_: Provides intergation layer with `Plone`_. Hooks up
      with Plone's ``KSS inline validation``, ``WYSIWYG widget`` and 
      ``Query select widget``.

    * `plone.autoform`_: Provides some convinience features for storing 'hints'
      on schema interfaces.

    * `plone.directives.form`_: Provides Grok-like style for defining forms.

Lets see them a little bit more in detail..
